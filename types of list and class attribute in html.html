    <!-- <h1>What are different types of lists in HTML?</h1> -->
    <!-- <p>HTML Lists help to display a list of information semantically. There are three types of lists in HTML:1[Unordered list or Bulleted list (ul)]
        2[Ordered list or Numbered list (ol)]
        3[Description list or Definition list (dl)]
        </p> -->

        <!-- <h2>unordered or bullet list</h2> -->
        <!-- <p>the list items have no specific order or sequence. An unordered list is also called a Bulleted list, as the items are marked with bullets. It begins with the <ul> tag and and closes with a </ul> tag. The list items begin with the <li> tag and end with </li> tag</p> -->

        <!-- <h3>ordered list or numbered list</h3> -->
        <!-- <p>all the list items in an ordered list are marked with numbers by default instead of bullets. An HTML ordered list starts with the <ol> tag and ends with the </ol> tag. The list items start with the <li> tag and end with </li> tag.</p> -->

        <!-- <h4>Description List or Definition List</h4> -->
        <!-- <p>he list items are listed like a dictionary or encyclopedia. Each item in the description list has a description. You can use a description list to display items like a glossary</p> -->





        <!-- <h5>Class Attribute</h5> -->
        <!-- <p>The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet</p> -->
